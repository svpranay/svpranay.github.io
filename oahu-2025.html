  <h1>Oahu Trip: Dec 16–22</h1>

  <p>
    We visited Oahu from December 16–22 and stayed in Honolulu. Being in the city
    was convenient, but there was definitely traffic and it sometimes took time
    to get around.
  </p>

  <h2>Costs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> $1,800</li>
    <li><strong>Flights for three:</strong> $1,600</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Beaches</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Lanikai Beach</strong> was one of the most beautiful beaches we saw — clear water and soft sand.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Waimanalo Beach</strong> was also very pretty and relaxing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Waikiki Beach</strong> was nearby and easy to get to, but not as pretty as Lanikai and Waimanalo.
  </p>
  <p>
    We did snorkeling at <strong>Hanauma Bay</strong>, which was the best snorkeling site we visited in Oahu. A reservation is needed.
  </p>

  <h2>Drives</h2>
  <p>
    The drive from Kailua toward the northern part of the island was very scenic and definitely recommended.
  </p>

  <h2>Pearl Harbor</h2>
  <p>
    We visited Pearl Harbor and saw the sunken ships. A reservation is needed here as well.
  </p>

  <h2>Rain, chocolate, and other stops</h2>
  <p>
    There was quite a bit of rain, and some of our plans got drenched.
  </p>
  <p>
    We visited the Manoa Chocolate Factory, where Viaan tried so many chocolates that he almost started hating chocolate.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also went to the Dole Plantation. There is a train ride there, but Viaan was mostly asleep, so Pranay and Viaan stayed in the car.
  </p>

  <h2>Waikiki area, turtles, and coconuts</h2>
  <p>
    We walked around the shopping area in Waikiki. It is very walking-friendly with lots of shops and restaurants.
  </p>
  <p>
    We saw turtles on the northern beaches, which was exciting.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also tried coconuts, which had a unique taste. We were not sure if they were actually from Hawaii or not.
  </p>

  <h2>ISKCON visit</h2>
  <p>
    We visited an ISKCON place, which also had a restaurant serving good food.
