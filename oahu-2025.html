Oahu Trip: Dec 16–22

We visited Oahu from December 16–22 and stayed in Honolulu. Being in the city was convenient, but there was definitely traffic and it sometimes took time to get around.

Costs
Airbnb: $1,800
Flights for three: $1,600


Beaches

Lanikai Beach was one of the most beautiful beaches we saw — clear water and soft sand.

Waimanalo Beach was also very pretty and relaxing.

Waikiki Beach was nearby and easy to get to, but not as pretty as Lanikai and Waimanalo.

We did snorkeling at Hanauma Bay, which was the best snorkeling site we visited in Oahu. A reservation is needed.

Drives

The drive from Kailua toward the northern part of the island was very scenic and definitely recommended.

Pearl Harbor

We visited Pearl Harbor and saw the sunken ships. A reservation is needed here as well.

Rain, chocolate, and other stops

There was quite a bit of rain, and some of our plans got drenched.

We visited the Manoa Chocolate Factory, where Viaan tried so many chocolates that he almost started hating chocolate.

We also went to the Dole Plantation. There is a train ride there, but Viaan was mostly asleep, so Pranay and Viaan stayed in the car.

Waikiki area, turtles, and coconuts

We walked around the shopping area in Waikiki. It is very walking-friendly with lots of shops and restaurants.

We saw turtles on the northern beaches, which was exciting.

We also tried coconuts, which had a unique taste. We were not sure if they were actually from Hawaii or not.

ISKCON visit

We visited an ISKCON place, which also had a restaurant serving good food.
