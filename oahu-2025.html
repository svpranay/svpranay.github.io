    <h1>Oahu Trip: Dec 16–22</h1>

    <p>
      We visited Oahu from December 16–22 and stayed in Honolulu. Being in the city
      was convenient, but there was definitely traffic and it sometimes took time
      to get around.
    </p>

    <h2>Costs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> $1,800</li>
      <li><strong>Flights for three:</strong> $1,600</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beaches</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Lanikai Beach</strong> was one of the most beautiful beaches we saw — clear water and soft sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Waimanalo Beach</strong> was also very pretty and relaxing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Waikiki Beach</strong> was nearby and easy to get to, but not as pretty as Lanikai and Waimanalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did snorkeling at <strong>Hanauma Bay</strong>, which was the best snorkeling site we visited in Oahu. A reservation is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Drives</h2>
    <p>
      The drive from Kailua toward the northern part of the island was very scenic and definitely recommended.
    </p>

    <h2>Pearl Harbor</h2>
    <p>
      We visited Pearl Harbor and saw the sunken ships. A reservation is needed here as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Rain, chocolate, and other stops</h2>
    <p>
      There was quite a bit of rain, and some of our plans got drenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      We visited the Manoa Chocolate Factory, where Viaan tried so many chocolates that he almost started hating chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also went to the Dole Plantation. There is a train ride there, but Viaan was mostly asleep, so Pranay and Viaan stayed in the car.
    </p>

    <h2>Waikiki area, turtles, and coconuts</h2>
    <p>
      We walked around the shopping area in Waikiki. It is very walking-friendly with lots of shops and restaurants.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw turtles on the northern beaches, which was exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also tried coconuts, which had a unique taste. We were not sure if they were actually from Hawaii or not.
    </p>

    <h2>ISKCON visit</h2>
    <p>
      We visited an ISKCON place, which also had a restaurant serving good food.
